# disk-sector-tools
A collection of low-level tools for working with disk sectors. This repository contains programs for reading, writing, and manipulating raw disk sector data, including operations on the Master Boot Record (MBR) and other disk structures. The tools are written in assembly and demonstrate basic disk I/O operations using system calls on Linux.
