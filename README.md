### Repository Name:
`disk-sector-tools`

### Repository Description:
A collection of low-level tools for working with disk sectors. This repository contains programs for reading, writing, and manipulating raw disk sector data, including operations on the Master Boot Record (MBR) and other disk structures. The tools are written in assembly and demonstrate basic disk I/O operations using system calls on Linux.

### Example of Usage:
- **Reading Disk Sectors**: The repository includes programs for reading the first sector (MBR) of a disk to examine its raw contents.
- **Writing to Disk Sectors**: Future tools will be added to write data to specific sectors on the disk, enabling more advanced manipulation of disk content.

This project is designed for developers and enthusiasts interested in low-level disk operations, disk recovery, or creating custom disk tools.
